# Smart-AC-Recommenation-System

Imagine having an intelligent assistant that not only keeps you comfortable but also helps you save energy. Our AIoT project brings this vision to life by creating a seamless connection between the outside world, your home, and smart decision-making.
We gather real-time weather data like temperature and humidity from the world outside, and at the same time, we keep track of the indoor climate using specialized sensors. We're even attentive to whether your AC is running or not, because every little detail matters.
All of this valuable information gets stored in a digital vault called a time series database. It's like a giant digital journal that captures how things change over time. But the real magic happens when we use advanced AI techniques to analyze all this data. It's like teaching our system to understand patterns and predict the future, but for home comfort!
When you have questions or need advice, our friendly AI assistant, powered by ChatGPT, is here to help. Wondering when to turn on the AC to avoid heat or humidity? Just ask! Our AI assistant dives into the treasure trove of data, looks at how the weather has been behaving, how comfy your home is right now, and even what your AC has been up to. Then, it cleverly suggests the best times to switch on the AC for maximum comfort and energy savings.But that's not all – we make sure you receive the advice in a way that suits you. Our AI can talk! You'll get to hear its recommendations spoken aloud, just like having a conversation. And if you prefer, you'll also receive the advice through your Telegram app.
What's truly exciting is that this system learns and evolves. The more people use it, the smarter it gets at predicting the best AC times. So, it's not just about making you feel cozy – it's about making homes smarter, saving energy, and contributing to a happier planet. Welcome to the future of intelligent home comfort!
